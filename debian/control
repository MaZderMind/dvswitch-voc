Description: basic video mixer for live DV streams - VOC version
 dvswitch is a very basic video mixer that receives DV streams from
 sources and sends a DV stream to sinks over a TCP/IP network.  It has
 a graphical interface in which all source streams can be viewed and
 selected from.
 .
 It is intended to be used for live editing at conferences.
 .
 This package contains a minimal version of dvswitch that tries to
 prevent maloperation.
