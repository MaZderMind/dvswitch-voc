dvswitch 0.3

This is barely ready for use.

You can configure the mixer's host and port using the -h and -p
options to any of the commands, or configure them for all commands by
setting MIXER_HOST=<hostname> and MIXER_PORT=<port> in ~/.dvswitchrc.
However this will probably change in later versions as we will use
multiple listening ports.

Run dvswitch and you will see a rather bare mixing window.  This only
knows keyboard commands: Control-Q to quit, digits to select between
sources, C to cut.

Now run dvsource-file to feed a file as a source and/or
dvsource-firewire to capture over Firewire.

Run dvsink-files to save the output to files.  It takes a filename
pattern which may include formatting sequences as used by strftime(3)
so that files are named according to the time when they are created.
It will open a new file every time you press C in the mixing window.
If the name pattern does not end with the suffix ".dv", this will be
added.  Finally, a hyphen and a number will be added before the ".dv"
if necessary to avoid filename collisions.

That's all for now.
