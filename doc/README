dvswitch 0.1

This is far from ready for use, but may serve as an early demonstration.

You can configure the mixer's host and port using the -h and -p
options to any of the commands, or configure them for all commands by
setting MIXER_HOST=<hostname> and MIXER_PORT=<port> in ~/.dvswitchrc.
However this will probably change in later versions as we will use
multiple listening ports.

Run dvswitch and you will see a rather bare mixing window.  This only
knows keyboard commands: Q to quit, digits to select between sources,
C to cut (which does nothing at present).

Now run dvsource-file to feed a file as a source and/or
dvsource-firewire to capture over Firewire.

Currently dvswitch only shows the selected source; previews of other
sources are not generated.  Sources are numbered in order of
connection starting from 0 (which should probably change to 1).

That's all for now.
