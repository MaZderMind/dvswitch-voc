dvswitch 0.2

This is far from ready for use, but may serve as an early demonstration.

You can configure the mixer's host and port using the -h and -p
options to any of the commands, or configure them for all commands by
setting MIXER_HOST=<hostname> and MIXER_PORT=<port> in ~/.dvswitchrc.
However this will probably change in later versions as we will use
multiple listening ports.

Run dvswitch and you will see a rather bare mixing window.  This only
knows keyboard commands: Control-Q to quit, digits to select between
sources, C to cut (which does nothing at present).

Now run dvsource-file to feed a file as a source and/or
dvsource-firewire to capture over Firewire.

That's all for now.
