Currently the GUI (main) thread wakes up at least once every 20
milliseconds to check whether a new frame has appeared.  We should
probably use a pipe to notify the GUI thread when a new frame is
available (must be some kind of file).

Clamping luma and chroma values may be a waste of time.

We should avoid converting video frames to RGB by using Xv for display.

We should decode in multiple threads if there are multiple processors
available.  dv_decode_full_frame currently prevents this with a mutex,
though there's no obvious shared state that would make it unsafe
without the mutex.
