Clamping luma and chroma values may be a waste of time (but turning
it off didn't seem to make much difference to processor usage).

We should decode in multiple threads if there are multiple processors
available.  dv_decode_full_frame currently prevents this with a mutex,
though there's no obvious shared state that would make it unsafe
without the mutex.

The server should use larger socket buffers or asynchronous I/O so
that it doesn't need to wake up so often.
